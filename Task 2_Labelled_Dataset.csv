The photo was taken at a Women's Day protest in Mexico, not a protest specifically about abortion rights. Also, the tweet misleads people to think that the reason the Mexican government decriminalized abortion is because of a protest about abortion, which is not true. The Mexican government ruled on Sept 7, 2021 that penalizing abortion is unconstitutional, while the protest on on abortion rights in Mexico was held on International Safe Abortion Day on Sept 28, 2021","May 2, 2022 at 11:18 PM",https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1521328439759761408,1540337296473526272,No,News,Yes,No,N/A,N/A,,"Jun 24, 2022 at 10:13 AM ",https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1540337296473526272,1540405941094326272,No,News,Yes,No,N/A,N/A,The content of the tweet is news about a celebrity's response.
